.. PackagingTest documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PackagingTest's documentation!
=========================================

.. you would list any documents to be included below the toctree directive and
   its options (with one blank line); you can either use only the document name
   without file extension or you could use
   <custom_heading> <document_name_without_extension> to specify a custom heading

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Table of Contents:
   :numbered:

   intro
   module1
   module2
   module3

--------------------------------

.. py:module:: MyIndexTest

.. index:: indextest


Indices and tables
==================

.. the special directives below generate a general index, a python module index
   and a search page. The general index is populated with entries from modules,
   index-generating object descriptions and index-directives; the module index
   contains one index per py:module directive.

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
